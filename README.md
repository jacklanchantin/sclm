# Source Code Language Model (SCLM)
We created a language model for source code in order to find buggy code. The intuition is that snippest of code with high Entropy according to the language model are likely to be buggy. See the [project slides](https://github.com/jacklanchantin/SourceCodeLanguageModel/blob/master/SourceCodeLanguageModel.pdf) for more information.

# Installation
## System setup
You'll need to install the header files for Python 2.7 and the HDF5 library. On Ubuntu you should be able to install
like this:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install python2.7-dev
sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev
```

## Python setup
The preprocessing script is written in Python 2.7; its dependencies are in the file `requirements.txt`.
You can install these dependencies in a virtual environment like this:

```bash
virtualenv .env                  # Create the virtual environment
source .env/bin/activate         # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python dependencies
# Work for a while ...
deactivate                       # Exit the virtual environment
```

## Lua setup
The main modeling code is written in Lua using [torch](http://torch.ch); you can find installation instructions
[here](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html#_). You'll need the following Lua packages:

- [torch/torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7)
- [torch/nn](https://github.com/torch/nn)
- [torch/optim](https://github.com/torch/optim)
- [lua-cjson](https://luarocks.org/modules/luarocks/lua-cjson)
- [torch-hdf5](https://github.com/deepmind/torch-hdf5)

After installing torch, you can install / update these packages by running the following:

```bash
# Install most things using luarocks
luarocks install torch
luarocks install nn
luarocks install optim
luarocks install lua-cjson

# We need to install torch-hdf5 from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/torch-hdf5
cd torch-hdf5
luarocks make hdf5-0-0.rockspec
```

### CUDA support (Optional)
To enable GPU acceleration with CUDA, you'll need to install CUDA 6.5 or higher and the following Lua packages:
- [torch/cutorch](https://github.com/torch/cutorch)
- [torch/cunn](https://github.com/torch/cunn)

You can install / update them by running:

```bash
luarocks install cutorch
luarocks install cunn
```

# Usage
To train a model and use it to generate new text, you'll need to follow three simple steps:

## Step 1: Preprocess the data
You can use any text file for training models. Before training, you'll need to preprocess the data using the script
`scripts/preprocess.py`; this will generate an HDF5 file and JSON file containing a preprocessed version of the data.

If you have training data stored in `my_data.txt`, you can run the script like this:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py \
  --input_txt my_data.txt \
  --output_h5 my_data.h5 \
  --output_json my_data.json
```

This will produce files `my_data.h5` and `my_data.json` that will be passed to the training script.

There are a few more flags you can use to configure preprocessing; [read about them here](doc/flags.md#preprocessing)

## Step 2: Train the model
After preprocessing the data, you'll need to train the model using the `train.lua` script. This will be the slowest step.
You can run the training script like this:

```bash
th train.lua -input_h5 my_data.h5 -input_json my_data.json
```

This will read the data stored in `my_data.h5` and `my_data.json`, run for a while, and save checkpoints to files with 
names like `cv/checkpoint_1000.t7`.

You can change the RNN model type, hidden state size, and number of RNN layers like this:

```bash
th train.lua -input_h5 my_data.h5 -input_json my_data.json -model_type rnn -num_layers 3 -rnn_size 256
```

By default this will run in GPU mode using CUDA; to run in CPU-only mode, add the flag `-gpu -1`.

To run with OpenCL, add the flag `-gpu_backend opencl`.

There are many more flags you can use to configure training; [read about them here](doc/flags.md#training).

## Step 3: Sample from the model
After training a model, you can generate new text by sampling from it using the script `sample.lua`. Run it like this:

```bash
th sample.lua -checkpoint cv/checkpoint_10000.t7 -length 2000
```

This will load the trained checkpoint `cv/checkpoint_10000.t7` from the previous step, sample 2000 characters from it,
and print the results to the console.

By default the sampling script will run in GPU mode using CUDA; to run in CPU-only mode add the flag `-gpu -1` and
to run in OpenCL mode add the flag `-gpu_backend opencl`.

There are more flags you can use to configure sampling; [read about them here](doc/flags.md#sampling).
